Our project works well with Python 3.7.9. We recommend installing it with the default settings.

Our project requires Visual Studio Build Tools.
When the installer loads, please select the first option:
	C++ build tools
	
This will install the necessary packages.

We apologize for the huge download size (4.68 GB download).
Without this, the pip packages WILL NOT install correctly.

After installing both required files, please proceed with the other README.txt
